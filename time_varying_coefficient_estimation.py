Desription: In this file the COVID-19 measures data are regressed on the COVID-19
reproduction number data. We use a time-varying coefficient model,
in which we estimate the coefficient functions using local linear regression.
Besides we return the inference results. For the Confidence Intervals we use the methods
programmed in "inference_bootstrap.py". As bandwith we use methods from "bandwith_selection.py".
